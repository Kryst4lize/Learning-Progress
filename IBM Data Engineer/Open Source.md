- **Open Source Software**: Defined as software that is free to use, with both the runnable version and source code available for public access. True open source projects adopt an open-governance model, allowing contributions from various organizations.
    
- **Importance in Big Data**: Open source projects are foundational to modern Big Data infrastructure. They often outlast individual organizations' interests, exemplified by the Linux Kernel, which has become the standard for servers worldwide.
    
- **Open Governance**: This model ensures transparency and community involvement in project development, similar to democratic governance. It often leads to profitable solutions.
    
- **Hadoop Ecosystem**: The primary component of Big Data, consisting of:
    
    - **MapReduce**: A framework for processing large data sets.
    - **Hadoop File System (HDFS)**: Manages and stores Big Data files, with 70% of the world's Big Data residing on it.
    - **YARN**: The resource manager for Hadoop, supporting various Big Data applications.
- **Modern Tools**: While Hadoop remains crucial, newer frameworks like Apache Spark are gaining popularity for their efficiency in data processing. Other tools like Hive and HBase also integrate with the Hadoop ecosystem.
    
- **Conclusion**: Open source is integral to Big Data, providing tools and frameworks that support data processing and analytics.
