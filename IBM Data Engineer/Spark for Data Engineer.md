- **Tasks Performed by Data Engineers Using Spark**:
    - **Data Ingestion**: Data engineers intake large volumes of data from various sources, including HDFS, cloud storage, databases, and streaming sources like Apache Kafka.
    - **Data Transformation**: After ingestion, they clean, filter, and aggregate data using Spark's APIs, performing tasks like joining datasets and pivoting.
    - **Data Storage Strategies**: Engineers design efficient data storage solutions using Spark's distributed storage capabilities, handling large datasets across systems like HDFS and Amazon S3.
    - **Complex Data Processing**: They utilize Spark for tasks such as graph processing, stream processing, and machine learning, building data processing pipelines for real-time and batch processing.
    - **Performance Optimization**: Data engineers optimize Spark performance by tuning parameters like partitioning and memory usage, as well as monitoring the Spark cluster for efficiency.
