[[Information Model and Data Model]]
# Examples
**Logistics in a Restaurant**

- Raw ingredients are delivered to restaurants, requiring careful unwrapping, sorting, labeling, and routing to appropriate storage areas like pantries and fridges.
- Proper organization ensures food safety, minimizes waste, and allows cooks to focus on preparing meals rather than searching for ingredients.

**Data Management in Organizations**
- Organizations receive data from various sources, similar to how restaurants receive ingredients, necessitating a quick and efficient way to store and process this data.
- Data lakes serve as a repository for raw data, while enterprise data warehouses (EDWs) optimize and organize data for specific analytical tasks.
**Challenges and Solutions**
- Data lakes can become "data swamps" due to poor governance and quality, leading to stale data that loses value over time.
- The introduction of data lake houses combines the flexibility of data lakes with the performance of data warehouses, allowing for efficient data management and analytics.
