- **Definition**: A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements stored and executed on the database server.
- **Benefits**:
    - **Reduction in Network Traffic**: Only one call is needed to execute multiple statements.
    - **Performance Improvement**: Processing occurs on the server where the data is stored.
    - **Code Reusability**: Multiple applications can use the same stored procedure.
    - **Increased Security**: Limits exposure of table and column information to client-side developers.
- **Creation**:
    - Use the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement, specifying the procedure name and parameters.
    - Enclose procedural logic within `BEGIN` and `END` statements.
    - Change the delimiter to avoid confusion with statement endings.
- **Calling Stored Procedures**: Use the `CALL` statement with the procedure name and required parameters.
