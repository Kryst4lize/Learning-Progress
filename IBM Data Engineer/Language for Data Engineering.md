Data professionals need a host of languages that can help them extract, prepare, and analyse data. These can be classified as:

- Querying languages, such as SQL, used for accessing and manipulating data from databases.
    
- Programming languages such as Python, R, and Java, for developing applications and controlling application behavior.
    
- Shell and Scripting languages, such as Unix/Linux Shell, and PowerShell, for automating repetitive operational tasks.
