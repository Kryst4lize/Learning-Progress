Depending on where the data must be sourced from ([[Data Source]]), there are a number of methods and tools available for gathering data. These include query languages for extracting data from databases, APIs, Web Scraping, Data Streams, RSS Feeds, and Data Exchanges. 

Once the data you need has been gathered and imported, your next step is to make it analytics-ready. This is where the process of [[Data Wrangling]], or Data Munging, comes in.

# Data Extraction 
[[Data]]]

**Raw Data Sources:**

- **Archived Text and Images:** Includes documents and PDFs.
- **Web Pages:** Comprises text, tables, images, and links.
- **Analog Media:** Involves audio and video recorded on magnetic tapes or streamed in real-time.
- **Survey and Statistical Data:** Gathers information from business, financial, real estate, and point of sale transactions.
- **Event-Based Data:** Captured from social media streams, weather data from networks, and IoT sensor streams.
- **Medical Records:** Encompasses prescription history, treatments, medical images, and genetic data.

**Data Extraction Techniques:**

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Converts scanned text from paper documents into a computer-readable format.
- **Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs):** Digitizes analog audio signals.
- **Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs):** Captures and digitizes images.
- **Polling and Census Methods:** Used for gathering opinions and vital statistics.
- **Web Scraping:** Crawls web pages to extract text, images, tables, and hyperlinks.
- **APIs:** Facilitate data extraction from online repositories, such as government statistics and social networks.
- **SQL and NoSQL:** Used for querying relational and non-structured databases, respectively.
- **Edge Computing Devices:** Such as video cameras that process and extract features from raw data.
- **Biomedical Devices:** For example, microfluidic arrays that extract DNA sequences.

**Use Cases:**

- **APIs for Integration:** Extract data from multiple structured sources for central repository integration.
- **Event Capture:** Use APIs to store periodic or asynchronous events in a history archive.
- **Edge Computing:** Reduces data volume from IoT devices by extracting relevant features at the source.
- **Medical Imaging and Biometric Sensors:** Acquire data for diagnostic purposes.
