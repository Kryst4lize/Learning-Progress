- **Definition of Functional Programming (FP)**:
    
    - FP is a programming style that emphasizes the "what" of a solution rather than the "how to." It follows a declarative syntax, abstracting implementation details.
- **Historical Context**:
    
    - LISP was the first functional programming language, developed in the 1950s. Modern languages that support FP include Scala, Python, R, and Java.
- **Key Features**:
    
    - **Lambda Functions**: These are anonymous functions used in FP, allowing for concise function definitions.
    - **First-Class Functions**: In languages like Scala, functions can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
- **Advantages of FP**:
    
    - **Parallelization**: FP allows for tasks to be split and executed in parallel without changing the function definitions, enhancing performance and scalability.
    - **Declarative Nature**: FP focuses on the outcome rather than the steps to achieve it, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.
- **Example**:

    - A simple functional program can increment a number in a list by one, contrasting with imperative programming that requires explicit loops.
