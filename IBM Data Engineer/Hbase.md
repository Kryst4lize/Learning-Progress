- HBase is a **column-oriented non-relational database management system** that operates on top of the **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**. It is designed for storing sparse data sets and provides fault tolerance.
    
- **Key Features**:
    
    - **Real-time Data Handling**: HBase is suitable for applications requiring random read and write access to large datasets.
    - **Scalability**: It is linearly scalable, meaning it can grow in both linear and modular forms.
    - **Dynamic Schema**: HBase allows for flexible schema changes, where new columns can be added to column families at any time.
