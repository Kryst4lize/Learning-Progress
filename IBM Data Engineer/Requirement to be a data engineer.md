The role of a Data Engineer includes:

- Gathering data from disparate sources.
    [[Data Collection]]
- Integrating data into a unified view for data consumers.
    [[Data platform]]
- Preparing data for analytics and reporting.
    [[Data Wrangling]]
- Managing data pipelines for a continuous flow of data from source to destination systems.
    [[Data Repositories, Data Pipelines, and Data Integration Platforms]]
- Managing the complete infrastructure for the collection, processing, and storage of data.

To be successful in their role, Data Engineers need a mix of **technical, functional, and soft skills**.

- Technical Skills include working with different operating systems and infrastructure components such as virtual machines, networks, and application services. I**t also includes working with databases and data warehouses, data pipelines, ETL tools, big data processing tools, and languages for querying, manipulating, and processing data**. [[Language for Data Engineering]]
    
- An understanding of the potential application of data in business is an important skill for a data engineer. Other functional skills include the ability to convert business requirements into technical specifications, an understanding of the software development lifecycle, and the areas of data quality, privacy, security, and governance.
    
- Soft Skills include interpersonal skills, the ability to work collaboratively, teamwork, and effective communication.

Data Engineering is reported to be one of the **top ten jobs growth** in the U.S. today. It is also reported to be one of the **fastest growing tech occupations** 

Currently, the demand for skilled data engineers far outweighs the supply, which means companies are willing to pay a premium to hire skilled data engineers.

Data engineering roles in organizations tend to break the specialization up into **Data Architecture, Database Design and Architecture, Data Platforms, Data Pipelines and ETL, Data Warehouses, and Big Data.**

Regardless of the niche you choose to specialize in, **knowledge of operating systems, languages, databases, and infrastructure components, is essential.**

To work your way up from a Junior Data Engineer to a Lead or Principal Data Engineer, you need to continually advance your technical, functional, and soft skills from a foundational level to an expert level. You need to not only expand your skills in your niche area, but also into other areas of data engineering at the same time.

Big Data Engineers and Machine Learning Engineers are some of the emerging roles in this field and they require specialized skills in addition to basic data engineering.

[[Python]] is one of the most versatile and most use in data engineer field for its flexibility 
## Other roles use cases:
Databases cater to various user roles, including: 
- Data engineers and DBAs, 
	Data engineers/DBAs manage databases using GUIs, command-line interfaces, and APIs for administrative tasks. 
- Data scientists and Analysts
	Data scientists analysts leverage tools like Jupyter, R Studio, and SQL interfaces for analysis, while BI tools like PowerBI, and Tableau abstract SQL interactions. 
- Application developers, 
	Application developers use programming languages and ORM frameworks for application development
