Based on how well-defined the **structure of the data** is, data can be categorized as
## Overall 
- **Structured data**, that is data which is well organized in formats that can be stored in databases. [[Relational Databases]]
    **Characteristic:**
    1. Follow a defined format
    2. Includes tables with rows and columns 
    3. Ensure consistency and easy retrieval
    4. Adhere to a strict schema
	**Format:**
	1. Spreadsheets: Data arrange in rows and columns
	2. SQL databases: Data store in rows and columns 
	4. Online forms: Data store in records in designate fields 
	
- **Semi-structured data**, that is data which is partially organized and partially free-form. [[Non-relational Databases]]
	**Characteristic:**
	1. Possesses some organizational properties 
	2. Does not follow strict tabular structure
	3. Employ hierarchical structures or tags
	4. Provide a balance between flexibility and structure 
	**Format: **
	1. JSON file: Contain arrays and objects (JavaScript Object Notation)
	2. XML document: Includes tags, attributes and schema
	3. Emails: Include a structure field but unstructured body 
- **Unstructured data**, that is data which can not be organized conventionally into rows and columns.
	**Characteristic:**

	2. Does not conform to any predefined rules
	**Format:**
    1. Text file: Contain free-from text documents
    2. Media file: Include Image, audio and video
    3. Web pages: Store texts, Image and multimedia
    4. Social media contents: Including Post, Tweets, Reel ,... 

Data comes in a **wide-ranging variety of file formats**, such as, delimited text files, spreadsheets, XML, PDF, and JSON, each with its own list of benefits and limitations of use.
Category: 
- Delimiter text file:
	1. Row separated by character
	2. Example: CSV( comma), TSV (tab)
- Spreadsheet:
	1. Includes data in row column for manipulation
	2. Can extract to CSV
- Language file:
	1. Include XML and JSON
	2. Set rule and structure for encoding data
Data is extracted from **multiple data sources** ([[Data Source]], ranging from relational and non-relational databases, to APIs, web services, data streams, social platforms, and sensor devices.

The data must meet the governance and compliance policy [[Govern and Compliance]]
